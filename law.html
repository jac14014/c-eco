            <div class="statute-text">
                <p><strong>On the Transition from Retrospective Causality to the Systemic Predictive Nexus and Trajectory Protection</strong></p>
                <p>Contemporary legal systems have been, for the most part, structured upon models of retrospective liability in which normative intervention occurs only after the materialization of harm. While this architecture has proven functional for localized and reversible risks, it is structurally insufficient to address systemic, cumulative, and irreversible risks whose effects transcend contractual, sectoral, and territorial boundaries.</p>
                <p>The interdependence between economic activities, critical infrastructures, and biophysical systems mandates that Law act upon risk trajectories rather than merely responding to consummated events, since, in systemic contexts, awaiting the occurrence of harm compromises the very possibility of reversal and hollows out the efficacy of legal protection based exclusively on posterior remediation.</p>
                <p>In this context, this Statute recognizes the emergence of trajectory illegality, referred to as ilicitude de trajetória, understood as the situation in which formally lawful acts, when executed in an unconditioned or inertial manner, lead in a technically predictable way to the collapse of systems essential to habitability, economic stability, or institutional integrity. As a result, the classical distinction between lawfulness and unlawfulness proves insufficient and gives way to the criterion of systemic compatibility of the execution trajectory.</p>
                <p>The c-ΣCO Regime promotes the replacement of retrospective causality with the systemic predictive nexus through which the validity, enforceability, and continuity of legal bonds are strictly conditioned upon the preservation of the Safe Operating Space and upon the technical reversibility of risk trajectories, as verified by objective, verifiable, and auditable technical data.</p>
                <p>In order to operationalize this transition, the Statute establishes a set of structural legal mechanisms whose coordinated functions neutralize systemic risk at different stages of the legal relationship. Ex-ante unenforceability operates as a validity filter through which contractual or administrative claims that have become systemically unsustainable, despite formal perfection, are deprived of executive force, thereby preventing judicial or regulatory authorities from compelling the performance of obligations that would deepen the risk of collapse.</p>
                <p>Systemic preclusion functions as an immediate block on the continuation of formally lawful acts once they reach predefined technical danger thresholds, with the purpose of halting inertial trajectories before they advance toward biophysical irreversibility.</p>
                <p>The conditioned immediate object links the very legal existence of the required performance to the maintenance of the integrity of the underlying asset, such that material instability affecting the life-support system triggers the automatic transformation of the contractual object, thereby prioritizing the safeguarding of the system over the original financial or economic delivery.</p>
                <p>Enforcement linked to certified sensory data establishes a regime of legal automation grounded in verifiable biophysical reality, under which monitoring devices and certified technological systems are capable of activating safety protocols and suspending activities in real time, thus eliminating the temporal gap between physical danger and normative response.</p>
                <p>These instruments are strictly preventive and conservatory in nature and are designed for the immediate containment of trajectories incompatible with systemic stability. They do not possess a punitive character but instead operate as imperatives directed toward the preservation of material public order and the continuity of the Earth System.</p>

                <p class="statute-text">Governance under the c-ΣCO regime operates primarily ex ante, acting upon risk trajectories identified prior to the materialization of harm, and institutes Systemic Preclusion as an immediate legal impediment to the exercise of legal faculties, acts, contracts, or operations whenever the technical continuity of an asset, operation, or projected impact is incompatible with systemic stability, habitability, or reversibility.</p>

                <p class="statute-text">III — Operational and Compliance Risk (80% Trigger). Applicable to impacts of low systemic complexity and full technical reversibility...</p>
                <p class="statute-text">§2º — Default Threshold. In the absence of a specific threshold definition issued by the Technical Standards Committee for a given risk category, a default probability threshold of fifty percent (50%) shall apply for purposes of suspension of enforceability and the incidence of systemic preclusion.</p>
                <p class="statute-text">§3º — Probative Effect and Immediate Efficacy. The technical certification that a trajectory has reached the applicable critical probability threshold constitutes full and sufficient proof for the automatic suspension of the efficacy of any obligation, act, or operation. Such suspension shall not be subject to suspensive effect by administrative, judicial, or arbitral appeals.</p>
                <p class="statute-text">§4º — Legal Nature of Preventive Preclusion. Preventive preclusion does not constitute a sanction, penalty, or finding of fault, but rather a functional legal adjustment to biophysical reality.</p>

The performance of any obligation shall be valid and enforceable only for so long as the systemic conditions ensuring the preservation of habitability and the maintenance of the Safe Operating Space (SOS) are effectively verified.</p>
                <p class="statute-text">§1º — Relational and Non-Absolute Nature. The immediate object shall not constitute an absolute, autonomous, or unconditional right, but a functionally conditioned legal performance, inseparable from the biophysical and systemic context that sustains its execution.</p>
                <p class="statute-text">§2º — Continuous Systemic Compatibility. The existence, enforceability, and legal effects of any obligation subject to the c-ΣCO regime remain subject to continuous systemic compatibility. Where the monitored technical trajectory deviates from the thresholds of reversibility, habitability, or systemic safety, the immediate object shall be deemed juridically frustrated, ex lege.</p>
                <p class="statute-text">§3º — Automatic Functional Suspension. Upon objective technical certification of systemic instability, loss of reversibility, or incompatibility with the Safe Operating Space, the obligation shall be automatically suspended by operation of law, irrespective of default, notice, or prior judicial, administrative, or arbitral declaration.</p>

                <p class="statute-text">§1º — Dynamic and Conditional Existence.

                <p class="statute-text">Ex-Ante Unenforceability (IEX) constitutes an autonomous legal category, of material public order, by which the enforceability of obligations, execution rights, and the practice of operational acts are automatically suspended whenever predictive technical analysis indicates that the continuation of performance would lead to a trajectory incompatible with systemic reversibility or with the stability of the Safe Operating Space (SOS).</p>

Ex-Ante Unenforceability shall not be confused with, nor recharacterized as, default, non-performance, supervening impossibility, force majeure, fortuitous event, hardship, material adverse change, suspension for non-performance, or any other traditional category of the law of obligations.</p>
                <p class="statute-text">§2º — Technical Trigger and Preventive Nature. The incidence of IEX arises exclusively from objective technical evidence, produced in accordance with the Systemic Proof regime, demonstrating trajectory deviation, critical risk, or prospective loss of reversibility, irrespective of the occurrence of material harm or contractual breach.</p>
                <p class="statute-text">§6º — Imperative and Non-Derogable Character. Ex-Ante Unenforceability is imperative and non-derogable within the c-ΣCO regime. Any clause, agreement, guarantee, decision, or practice intended to exclude, delay, neutralize, or circumvent its incidence is null and without legal effect.</p>
