    <h1>What is c-ECO?</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>c-ECO</strong> (<em>Contractual Equity & Ecological Co-Responsibility</em>) is a legal doctrine of
      <strong>pre-threshold contractual governance</strong>. It reorients contract law from a reactive,
      post-damage framework toward anticipatory decision-making under conditions of ecological and systemic risk.
    </p>

    <p>
      The doctrine is designed to operate in contexts where traditional legal categories fail to capture
      cumulative harm, irreversible ecological thresholds, and distributed responsibility across human and
      non-human actors.
    </p>

    <h2>Origin of the Doctrine</h2>

    <p>
      The c-ECO doctrine was developed as a response to the limits of classical contract law, ESG compliance,
      and sustainability frameworks when faced with planetary-scale risks and Earth system instability.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rather than focusing on compensation after harm occurs, c-ECO introduces a normative architecture
      centered on <strong>decision-making before damage</strong>, reallocating responsibility at the
      contractual level.
    </p>

    <h2>Core Focus Areas</h2>

    <p>
      c-ECO addresses:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Ecological risk allocation in contracts</li>
      <li>Pre-threshold decision-making and precaution</li>
      <li>Planetary and systemic responsibility</li>
      <li>Contracts involving non-human and environmental interests</li>
      <li>Limits of ESG, compliance, and traditional sustainability models</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Founder</h2>

    <p>
      The c-ECO doctrine was founded by <strong>Jacqueline A. Ennis</strong> as an original legal-theoretical
      framework integrating contract law, ecological governance, and Earth system responsibility.
    </p>

    <h2>Positioning</h2>

    <p>
      c-ECO is not a policy guideline, certification, or voluntary standard. It is a
      <strong>doctrinal reconstruction of contract law</strong>, capable of informing legislation,
      adjudication, institutional design, and private ordering under conditions of systemic ecological risk.
